# Walk With Me
This is a website that lets users 'friend' other users who take a common route on their daily walks.
##Features:
##Easy user interface:
- The application provides a simple interface for users to register.
## Suggests routes :
- The application suggests all possible routes between the user’s chosen
source and destination.
## CheckPoints:
-Another way for users to enter routes is by marking all checkpoints
which they meet on their regular walk routes.
- The application provides matches based on more than two common
checkpoints present in user’s routes.
##Socializing:
-The application allows likeminded
people to connect. It provides users
an option to enter preferred age group and interests of potential friends.
- Based on the acceptable routes, interests and age, the application
suggests possible matches.
##Secure Platform:
- The user is allowed to choose people within the suggested list to add as
their friends.
- The application provides a secure platform to find friends; i.e contact
details of a user are exchanged only after the consent of both users is
obtained.
- Once a user chooses a particular person from the suggested list, a
confirmation request is sent to the other user. Only when the user accepts
the confirmation, the contact details of both the users are exchanged.
## Notification:
- The application provides users an option to receive confirmation
messages and contact details via registered email ID or via message.
